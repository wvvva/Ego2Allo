30,location_closer_to_camera,Consider the real-world 3D location of the objects. Which object is further away from the camera?,,A,B,False,"[Reasoning] The green cube is larger and closer to the viewer, as indicated by its size and position in the image. The tennis racket is not visible in the image, so it cannot be compared directly. However, since the green cube is clearly closer to the camera, the tennis racket, if it were present, would be further away. But since the tennis racket is not in the image, the only object present is the green cube, which is closer to the camera. Therefore, the tennis racket is not a valid option for being further away, as it is not present. The question asks which object is further away, and since the tennis racket is not in the image, it cannot be the correct answer. The green cube is the only object present, and it is closer to the camera. Therefore, the correct answer is not A or B, as the tennis racket is not present. However, since the question asks for the letter of the correct answer, and the only object present is the green cube, which is closer to the camera, the tennis racket is further away, but it is not present. Therefore, the correct answer is not A or B.

65,multi_object_parallel,"Consider the real-world 3D orientations of the objects. What is the relationship between the orientations of the toliets, parallel of perpendicular to each other?",,A,A,True,"[Reasoning] The image shows only one green cube, which is labeled as a toilet. Since there is only one toilet, there is no second toilet to compare its orientation with. Therefore, the concept of ""relationship between orientations"" does not apply. However, the question asks for a choice between ""parallel"" or ""perpendicular,"" and since there is no second object, the relationship cannot be determined. But given the options and the context, the most appropriate answer is that there is no relationship, which is not listed. However, since the question forces a choice, and assuming the question might have intended to imply a comparison with another object (which is not present), the answer would be ""A. parallel"" as a default if no orientation is specified. But strictly speaking, the question is flawed. However, since the instruction is to choose from A or B, and there is no second object, the answer is not logically determinable. But since the question is presented as a multiple-choice question with only two options, and the only logical answer is that there is no relationship, but since that is not an option, the answer is not applicable. However, since the instruction is to choose from A or B, and the only possible answer is that they are not related, but since that is not an option, the answer is not determinable.

If I stand at the cat's position facing where it is facing, is the dog on the left or right of me?",,A,B,False,"[Reasoning] The image does not contain a cat or a yellow cube; it only contains a series of nested squares and a small purple object at the center. The color-object map provided indicates that the ""yellow cube"" corresponds to the ""dog,"" but there is no visual representation of a dog or a yellow cube in the image. Therefore, the question is based on an incorrect or non-existent mapping. Since the image does not contain the cat or the yellow cube, we cannot determine the relative position of the yellow cube (which is the dog) relative to the cat. However, since the question asks for a choice between ""left"" or ""right,"" and there is no valid information to determine the position, the correct answer is not determinable from the image.

135,multi_object_parallel,"Consider the real-world 3D orientations of the objects. What is the relationship between the orientations of the red car and the street sign that says ""Lakeside AV"", parallel of perpendicular to each other?",,A,B,False,"[Reasoning] The green cube and yellow cube are positioned in 3D space with their red arrows indicating their facing directions. The green cube's arrow points directly toward the viewer (along the negative z-axis), while the yellow cube's arrow points diagonally upward and to the right (along a direction that is not aligned with the green cube's axis). This indicates that their orientations are not aligned, meaning they are not parallel. Since the angle between their facing directions is not 0° or 180° (which would indicate parallel), and not 90° (which would indicate perpendicular), we must determine if they are perpendicular. The green cube's arrow is aligned with the negative z-axis, and the yellow cube's arrow has components along both the x and y axes. The dot product of their direction vectors is not zero, meaning they are not perpendicular. Therefore, the correct relationship is not parallel or perpendicular, but the question only provides these two options. Given the visual evidence, the most accurate choice is that they are not parallel, and since they are not perpendicular either, the question may be flawed. However, based on the options provided, the correct answer is not explicitly available. But since the question asks for the relationship between orientations, and the green cube's arrow is pointing directly toward the viewer while the yellow cube's arrow is pointing diagonally, they are not parallel.
