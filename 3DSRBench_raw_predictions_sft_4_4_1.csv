Which object is further away from the camera?,,,B,False,"[Reasoning] The green cube is larger and closer to the viewer, as indicated by its size and position in the image. The tennis racket is not visible in the image, so it cannot be compared directly. However, since the green cube is explicitly shown and is closer to the viewer, the tennis racket, if it were present, would be further away. But since the tennis racket is not in the image, the question is based on the given objects. The green cube is the only object mentioned, and it is closer to the viewer. Therefore, the tennis racket, if it were present, would be further away. But since the tennis racket is not in the image, the correct answer is not applicable.

What is the relationship between the orientations of the toliets, parallel of perpendicular to each other?",,A,A,True,"[Reasoning] The image shows only one green cube, which is labeled as a toilet. Since there is only one toilet, there is no second toilet to compare its orientation with. Therefore, the concept of ""relationship between orientations"" does not apply. However, the question asks to choose between ""parallel"" or ""perpendicular"" as the relationship, implying a comparison between two objects. Given that there is only one object, the relationship cannot be determined, but since the question forces a choice, and no orientation can be compared, the correct answer is not applicable. However, since the question requires selecting from A or B, and there is no valid relationship, the answer is not logically determinable. But based on the structure of the question and the fact that no orientation comparison is possible, the answer is not A or B. However, since the question requires a choice, and the only possible answer is that they are not related, but since the options are only A or B, and the question is flawed, the answer is not logically determinable.

Which object is further away from the camera?,,A,A,True,"[Reasoning] The green cube is the only object visible in the image, and it is positioned closer to the camera compared to any other object that might be implied (such as a stove or microwave, which are not visible). Since the green cube is the only object present and is clearly closer to the viewer, there is no other object to compare it with that is further away. Therefore, the question is based on a misunderstanding or incomplete information, as no other object is visible or mentioned. However, since the green cube is the only object present, it is the closest, and thus, the only object that can be considered ""further away"" from the camera is not applicable. But if forced to choose based on the given options and the only object present, the green cube is the only one, so it cannot be further away. However, since the question asks for the object further away, and there is no such object, the correct answer is not applicable. But since the options are limited to A or B, and the green cube is the only object, it is not further away.

If I stand at the cat's position facing where it is facing, is the dog on the left or right of me?",,A,B,False,"[Reasoning] The image does not contain a cat or a yellow cube; it only shows a series of nested squares with a small purple object at the center. The color-object map provided indicates that the ""yellow cube"" is mapped to the ""dog,"" but there is no visual representation of a yellow cube or a dog in the image. Therefore, the question is based on an incorrect or non-existent mapping. Since the image does not contain the cat or the yellow cube, we cannot determine the relative position of the yellow cube (which is the dog) relative to the cat. However, the question asks for a choice between ""left"" or ""right"" based on the cat's position and facing direction, which is not applicable. Given the lack of relevant visual information, the correct answer cannot be determined from the image. But since the question requires selecting an option (A or B) and the image does not contain the cat or yellow cube, the answer is not logically derivable. However, the instruction is to return the letter of the correct answer, and since the image does not contain the cat or yellow cube, the question is invalid.
