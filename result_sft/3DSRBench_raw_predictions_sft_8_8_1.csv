Which object is further away from the camera?,,A,B,False,"[Reasoning] The green cube is larger and closer to the viewer, as indicated by its size and position in the image. The tennis racket is not visible in the image, so it cannot be compared directly. However, since the green cube is clearly closer to the camera, the tennis racket, if it were present, would be further away. But since the tennis racket is not in the image, the question is based on the given objects. The green cube is the only object mentioned, and it is closer to the camera. Therefore, the tennis racket is not present, so it cannot be the correct answer. The question is flawed, but based on the given options, the green cube is closer, so the tennis racket is further away.

65,multi_object_parallel,"Consider the real-world 3D orientations of the objects. What is the relationship between the orientations of the toliets, parallel of perpendicular to each other?",,A,A,True,"[Reasoning] The image shows only one green cube, which is labeled as a toilet. Since there is only one toilet, there is no second toilet to compare its orientation with. Therefore, the concept of ""relationship between orientations"" does not apply. However, the question asks for a choice between ""parallel"" or ""perpendicular,"" and since there is no second object, the relationship cannot be determined. But given the options and the context, the most appropriate answer is that there is no relationship, which is not listed. However, since the question forces a choice, and assuming the question might have intended to imply a comparison with another object (which is not present), the answer would be that they are not perpendicular or parallel because there is only one. But since the question is flawed, and we must choose from A or B, and since the orientation of a single object cannot be compared to another, the correct answer is not applicable. However, the question might be a trick, and since there is only one toilet, the relationship is undefined.

Therefore, no valid answer can be given. However, if forced to choose based on the viewer's perspective (assuming the horse is a misnomer for the viewer), the yellow cube is on the right. But since the horse does not exist, the correct response is that the question is invalid. Given the constraints of the task, and assuming the question intends to refer to the viewer's position, the answer is B. on the right."
