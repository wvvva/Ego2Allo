Which side of the white truck is facing the mini stop sign?,"The image shows a green cube (labeled as ""d"") with a red arrow pointing away from it, indicating its front-facing direction. Since the green cube is positioned in the foreground and the red arrow points toward the viewer, the green cube's front is oriented toward the viewer.

However, since the green cube is in the foreground and the red arrow points toward the viewer, the green cube’s front is facing the viewer, and if the truck were positioned such that its front is facing the viewer, then the green cube would be on the truck’s front side. But since the truck is not visible, we cannot confirm this. The question asks for the side of the white truck facing the mini stop sign, but there is no mini stop sign in the image; instead, there is a green cube. Therefore, the question may be misphrased or incomplete.
